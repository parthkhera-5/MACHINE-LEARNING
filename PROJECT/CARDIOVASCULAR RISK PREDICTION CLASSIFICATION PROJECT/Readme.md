**#🫀 Cardiovascular Risk Prediction - Machine Learning Project**

**🏡 Overview**

This project is a machine learning-based predictive modeling initiative focused on assessing the risk of cardiovascular disease using health and lifestyle factors. Designed and executed entirely in Google Colab, it walks through the full data science pipeline — from raw data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

Whether you're a healthcare researcher, data scientist, or enthusiast, this project provides valuable insights into the application of ML in public health.

**✨ Key Features**

**📊 1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**

Cleans raw health-related data.

Handles missing values using appropriate imputation strategies.

Applies normalization and encoding to prepare data for modeling.

**🔎 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Uses statistical summaries and visualizations to understand:

Distribution of health indicators (e.g., age, cholesterol, BMI).

Correlations among features and cardiovascular outcomes.

Patterns and anomalies.

**🧠 3. Feature Engineering & Selection**

Creates informative features to enhance model performance.

Uses correlation analysis and model-based importance metrics to retain only impactful variables.

**🤖 4. Predictive Model Development**

Implements and compares several machine learning classifiers:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

CatBoost

Voting Classifier (Ensemble)

**📈 5. Model Evaluation**

Evaluates models using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

ROC-AUC Score

Confusion Matrix

**🔍 6. Model Interpretability**

Extracts feature importances to understand key risk factors.

Leverages visual tools and metrics for interpretability.

**☁️ 7. Google Colab Deployment**

Entire project is self-contained within Google Colab.

No installation required beyond a web browser and internet connection.
