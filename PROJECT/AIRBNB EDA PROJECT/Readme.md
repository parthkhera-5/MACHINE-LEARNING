**🏠 Airbnb Machine Learning Project**

**🏡 Project Overview**

This project is a machine learning initiative centered around analyzing Airbnb listing data. The goal is to develop predictive models for tasks such as:

- Predicting listing prices

- Identifying key factors that influence rental values

- Classifying listing types

All development and execution happen entirely within the Google Colab environment, ensuring easy accessibility and reproducibility.

**✨ Key Aspects**

**📊 Data Analysis**

Comprehensive exploration and visualization of Airbnb datasets.

Uncover trends, patterns, and insights in listings.

**🔧 Feature Engineering**

Construct meaningful features from raw data.

Improve model accuracy and robustness by refining inputs.

**☁️ Google Colab Environment**

Fully cloud-based workflow.

No local setup required beyond a web browser.
